# What is an Algorithm:

* This is a step by step procedure for solving computational problems.

# How about Programs: 

* They are also step by step procedure for solving problems.

# Software Development LifeCycle is divided into 2 majorly

* The Design
* The Implementation


* Algorithm are written at Design Time.
* The writer of Algorthm should have a domain knowledge
* Any language can be used, or mathematical Notation can be used, as long as they are understandable by the user.
* Hardware and Software OS
* Analyze 


  <---------------------------------->

* Programs  are written at Implementation Time 
* The writer of programs are programmers
* A Programming Langauge
* They are independent of Hardware and Software OS 
* Testing 

  <-------------------------------->

# The Priori Analysis
* Algorithm
* Independent of Language
* Hardware Independent
* Time and Space Function


# The Posterion Testing
* Program
* Langauage dependent
* Hardware dependent
* Watch time and bytes

# Characteristics of Algorithm


*  Input
*  Output
*  Definiteness
*  Finiteness
*  Effectiveness
